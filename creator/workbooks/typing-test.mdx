# Setup

Make sure that you have installed [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your machine before getting started with the project. Also, check that you have a code editor/IDE installed; if you don't have one, I recommend installing [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download/).

Once you have installed both Python and Visual Studio Code (or any code editor/IDE of your choice), create a Python file (a.k.a. **.py** file) and write

```py
print("Hello, World!")
```

Now, run your code!

Alright! Let's get started!

# About the Project

This python script will prompt users to type into the terminal/command line a certain number of words as chosen by the users themselves. It will then calculate the typing speed and accuracy based on the time taken to type the specified number of characters and the number of words spelled correctly respectively.

# Getting the Words

Before even writing any code, we need to have a list of words the users can type. Luckily, MIT has a text file of valid English words made available to the public [here](https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000). The text file, **words.txt** is included in this project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/xyntechx/NexLiber-Projects/blob/main/Typing%20Test/words.txt). Download the text file into the folder your Python file, **main.py**, is in.

# The "Interface"

Let's start by coding up the "user interface" of the project. We need the program to ask the users to input the number of words they wish to type. Hence, in **main.py**, we write

```py
number_of_words = int(input("How many words do you want to type (e.g. 50)? "))
```

Logically, we cannot have the user input 0 or a negative number, right? We should write a check for that!

```py
if number_of_words <= 0:
    raise Exception("Please input a positive integer!")
```

Next, we should generate the number of words as specified by the user. To do that, we would have to write a function which selects random words from the text file we downloaded earlier. For now, though, let's call the function first and define it later!

```py
words = generate_words("words.txt", number_of_words)
```

<Quiz
    question="Can you guess what the arguments of the function are?"
    choices={[
        "The name of the text file and the words to generate",
        "The name of the text file and the number of words to generate",
        "The word to type and the number of words to generate",
    ]}
    correctAnsIndex={1}
    correctMessage="That's right! generate_words() takes these 2 arguments!"
    wrongMessage="Are you sure?"
/>

We should also print out the words generated! So, include the following **print** statements!

```py
print("TYPE THE FOLLOWING WORDS...")
print(words)
```

It is timely now to create our timer! We need to record the time taken for the user to type the specified number of words, hence we will start the timer once the user is ready to type, and stop the timer once the user has finished typing all the words. We will use the Python **time** module to create the timer.

```py
prompt = input("Press Enter to start...")
start = time.time()
user_words = input()
end = time.time()
time_taken = end - start
```

Don't forget to import the module at the top of your Python file!

```py
import time
```

The purpose of **prompt** is to prevent the timer from starting before user is ready; the timer will only start once the user presses **Enter**. Then, we take the words typed by the user as input, storing them as a string in **user_words**. We stop the timer once the user presses **Enter** again, ideally after typing all the generated words. We can then calculate the time taken.

Afterwards, we want to calculate the speed and accuracy of the user. To do so, we will write the functions **evaluate_speed()** and **evaluate_accuracy()**. To calculate speed, we certainly need the number of words (or characters) the user has typed as well as the time taken to type them. To calculate accuracy, we definitely need the words typed by the user and the actual words to be typed.

```py
speed = evaluate_speed(user_words, time_taken)
accuracy = evaluate_accuracy(user_words, words)

print("Speed:", speed)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

Okay! We're now ready to write the functions!

# Generate Words

The function **generate_words()** takes 2 arguments: the name of the text file and the number of words to generate. We need to access **words.txt** and randomly select a certain number of words from it. The selection is random to increase the difficulty of the test, and therefore make it more interesting!

```py
def generate_words(file_name, number_of_words):
    with open(file_name) as file:
        word_set = set(file.read().split())
        words_used = list(word_set)[0: number_of_words]
        sentence = " ".join(words_used)
        return sentence
```

First, we open **words.txt**. Then, we read the file and split its contents per the whitespace (newlines) and hence per word, since every word in the file is in a new line. We convert the split file (which has become a list) into a set so that the words are randomised (a set in Python is a collection of unique elements in no particular order). This set is **word_set**. Of course, you can always use the **random** module, but this way also works, and it also ensures there will be no repeated words in the generated "sentence".

Since we want to select a certain number of words, we first reconvert the set of words into a list. The list can then be sliced to obtain the specified number of words. Then, we join the words in the list **words_used** with a space (" ") to form the string **sentence**. We return this string, which is the generated words to be typed by the user, from the function.

# Evaluate Speed

This function takes as input the words typed and the time taken to type those words. It then returns the typing speed in characters per minute (cpm). Usually, words per minute (wpm) is used, but I believe cpm is a more accurate measure since it is independent of biases like the length of the words generated.

```py
def evaluate_speed(words, time_taken):
    number_of_chars = len(words)
    time_taken_mins = time_taken / 60

    speed_magnitude = number_of_chars / time_taken_mins
    speed = "{:.1f}".format(speed_magnitude) + " cpm"

    return speed
```

To find the number of characters typed, we find the length of the string **words** which was typed by the user. Since the time taken calculated using the Python **time** module is in seconds, we convert it to minutes first before plugging it into the equation for speed. Finally, we return the calculated speed value corrected to 1 decimal place, just to make it look pretty.

# Evaluate Accuracy

Here is how accuracy is evaluated: we will compare the first generated word and the first typed word, award 1 point to the user if they are the same (typed word is correctly spelled) and 0 points if they are different (typed word is incorrectly spelled), and then move on to the next generated and typed words.

The function has 2 arguments: the words typed by the user and the words generated by **generate_words()**. To be able to compare a word from each of those strings with each other, we have to convert the strings into lists so that each index corresponds to a word, which is an element in the lists, instead of a character, which is an element in the strings.

```py
def evaluate_accuracy(user_words, actual_words):
    actual_list = actual_words.split()
    user_list = user_words.split()
```

Then, we initialise the score (number of points obtained by the user) to 0.

```py
score = 0
```

<Quiz
    question="Why initialise to 0?"
    choices={[
        `Because the user has yet to earn points`,
        `Because the user has typed every word wrongly`,
    ]}
    correctAnsIndex={0}
    correctMessage="Yup! Quite obvious, right?"
    wrongMessage="Dare to venture another guess?"
/>

We also need the total number of words as we want to find the number of correctly spelled words out of the total number of words. Hence, we find the length of **actual_list**.

```py
total = len(actual_list)
```

Since we need to loop over the lists, we must find the length of the lists. There is a chance that the user might give up halfway through typing, causing the length of **user_list** to be shorter than that of **actual_list**. There is also a chance that the user may overtype, causing the opposite to happen. We hence need the number of "rounds" of looping to be the smaller of the two lengths to prevent any indexing errors due to inaccessible indices in the shorter list.

```py
length = 0

if len(user_list) <= len(actual_list):
    length = len(user_list)
else:
    length = len(actual_list)
```

Now, we can finally write the actual comparison to tally up the score. Remember that the score increases by 1 for every correctly spelled word, and does not change for every incorrectly spelled word.

```py
for i in range(length):
    user_word = user_list[i]
    actual_word = actual_list[i]
    if user_word == actual_word:
        score += 1
```

We can now calculate and return accuracy, rounding it off to 1 decimal place, in percentage form.

```py
accuracy = "{:.1f}".format((score / total) * 100) + "%"
return accuracy
```

And... we're done!
