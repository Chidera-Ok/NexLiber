# Workbook Dev Guide
Congratulations! You are one step closer to becoming a published NexLiber Creator! Follow the steps below when writing your Workbook.

## Fork This repository
Since you do not have write access to `xyntechx/NexLiber`, you have to fork this repository before creating a pull request with the completed Workbook. Follow GitHub's official guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) to learn how you can fork a repository.

## Add Your Workbook
Here are the step-by-step instructions you should follow:
- Add your project details into `public/projects.json` -- follow the format [here](#format-projectsjson)
- Add your Workbook (`project-title.tsx`) into `pages/workbook/` -- follow the format [here](#format-project-titletsx)
- Commit your changes with the message "ðŸ”– Complete Workbook: **Project Title**"
- Push your changes to your fork's remote repository (the fork on your GitHub account)

### Format: `projects.json`
```json
"Project Title": {
    "description": "Project description",
    "field": "Project Field",
    "difficulty": "Difficulty",
    "creator": "Creator Name"
}
```

### Format: `project-title.tsx`
```tsx
import type { NextPage } from "next";
import Link from "next/link";
import styles from "../../styles/Workbook.module.css";
import WorkbookLayout from "../../layouts/WorkbookLayout";
// Other imports as necessary: Code, Pic, Quiz, etc.

const Workbook: NextPage = () => {
    return (
        <WorkbookLayout
            projectTitle="Project Title"
            content={
                <>
                    {/* Workbook content goes here */}
                </>
            }
        />
    );
};

export default Workbook;
```

## Create a Pull Request
Now, create a Pull Request (PR) to the original `xyntechx/NexLiber` repository by following GitHub's official guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

Things to note:
- Title your PR "ðŸ”– Complete Workbook: **Project Title**"
- Enter the **project description**, **field**, and **difficulty** in the comment field
- Additionally, enter your **name**, **GitHub username**, and **Discord username** in the comment field too

Your Workbook must be reviewed and approved by an admin before it is merged into the main branch.

## Next Steps
Upon merging, your Workbook will be put up on NexLiber, and you will be a published NexLiber Creator!
