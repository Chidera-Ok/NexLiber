# Setup

Before we get started, install [Node (version 10.13 or later)](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine.

Once that's done, open up your terminal and run the following command to create your Next.js project.

```
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Then, **cd** to your project's directory and run

```
npm run dev
```

as per the instructions written in your terminal. Using your browser, navigate to **http://localhost:3000**.

<Quiz
    question="What is the first line written on the website?"
    choices={[`Welcome to Next.js!`, `Hello, Next.js!`]}
    correctAnsIndex={0}
    correctMessage="Nice! You're on the right track!"
    wrongMessage="Oops! Try again!"
/>

Now, open your project in your favourite code editor/IDE; if you don't have one, I recommend installing [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

# About the Project

This workbook will guide you through creating your own simple portfolio website using Next.js. The website will look something like this...

<Pic
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xyntechx/NexLiber-Projects/main/Personal%20Portfolio%20Website/assets/2.png"
    alt="Complete Personal Portfolio Website"
    width={400}
    height={260}
/>

You will include your profile picture, about, skills, and projects in the website. Of course, this website looks quite plain, so you're free to modify it yourself once you have completed this Workbook!

# Cleaning Up

Let's start by removing some unnecessary code from the project's files. First, clean **Home.module.css** such that the file looks like this

```css
.container {
    padding: 0 2rem;
}

.main {
    min-height: 100vh;
    padding: 4rem 0;
    flex: 1;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```

Then, clean **index.js** such that the file looks like this

```jsx
import Head from "next/head";
import Image from "next/image";
import styles from "../styles/Home.module.css";

export default function Home() {
    return (
        <div className={styles.container}>
            <Head>
                <title>Create Next App</title>
                <meta
                    name="description"
                    content="Generated by create next app"
                />
                <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
            </Head>

            <main className={styles.main}></main>
        </div>
    );
}
```

<Quiz
    question="What do you see on the website?"
    choices={[`Nothing`, `Welcome to Next.js!`]}
    correctAnsIndex={0}
    correctMessage="Nice! You're on the right track!"
    wrongMessage="Oops! Try again!"
/>

# Into the Metaverse

Before we start adding content to and styling your website, let's take care of the website's meta values, including its favicon, title, and description.

You can change the website's favicon to your own logo or any other image! Just make sure to rename the image file to **favicon.ico** and move it to the **/public** directory of your project.

Now, change the **title** tag in **Head** to

```jsx
<title>My Website</title>
```

and the **meta** tag in **Head** to

```jsx
<meta name="description" content="My website created with NexLiber" />
```

or anything else you'd like!

<Quiz
    question="Did the look of your website change?"
    choices={[`Yes`, `No`]}
    correctAnsIndex={1}
    correctMessage="Correct! Changing the meta values doesn't change how your website looks like. The only visible changes for this case are the favicon and title of the website!"
    wrongMessage="Are you sure?"
/>

# Adding Content

A personal portfolio website wouldn't be complete without a profile picture. Add the best photo of yourself into the **/public** directory and name it **profile.png**. Now, we can make that image appear on the website by adding the code below within the **main** tag.

```jsx
<Image src="/profile.png" width={200} height={200} alt="My Profile Picture" />
```

For your information, **src** is the source URL of the image, **width** and **height** are the image dimensions in pixels, and **alt** is an attribute important for accessibility.

Below the image, add your name, about, skills, and projects.

```jsx
<div className={styles.content}>
    <h1 className={styles.name}>Nyx Iskandar</h1>
    <p className={styles.text}>
        A teen passionate about computer science, research, entrepreneurship,
        and service-learning.
    </p>
    <p className={styles.text}>Next.js | Angular | Nuxt 3 | Svelte</p>
    <p className={styles.text}>NexLiber | NXpyre | Code for Hope</p>
</div>
```

To beautify your website, add some classes to **Home.module.css**.

```css
.main {
    min-height: 100vh;
    padding: 2rem;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    column-gap: 5rem;
}

.content {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    width: 50%;
    text-align: center;
}

.name {
    font-size: 3rem;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.text {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    text-align: center;
    margin: 0.5rem 0;
}
```

Nice! This is how your website should roughly look like!

<Pic
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xyntechx/NexLiber-Projects/main/Personal%20Portfolio%20Website/assets/1.png"
    alt="Incomplete Personal Portfolio Website"
    width={400}
    height={260}
/>

# From Static to Interactive

Hmm... The website looks a little bit cluttered. Why don't we add some buttons to toggle between your about, skills, and projects? Let's add them underneath all the text.

```jsx
<div className={styles.buttonContainer}>
    <button className={styles.button}>About</button>
    <button className={styles.button}>Skills</button>
    <button className={styles.button}>Projects</button>
</div>
```

Let's style the buttons!

```css
.buttonContainer {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, minmax(0, 1fr));
    column-gap: 1rem;
    width: 100%;
    margin-top: 2rem;
}

.button {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    text-align: center;
    border: 0.1rem #3396ff solid;
    border-radius: 0.5rem;
    background-color: #fff;
    padding: 0.5rem;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: 0.3s;
}

.button:hover,
.button:focus {
    background-color: #3396ff;
}
```

Right now, the buttons don't do anything when clicked. We can make the buttons functional by using the **useState** method and some **if-else** statements.

First, import **useState**.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
```

Then, outside of **return()** write

```jsx
const [tab, setTab] = useState("about");
```

What this does is set the value of **tab** to **"about"**, and define a function **setTab()** which changes the value of **tab** to the argument passed into it when called. We will change the value of **tab** every time a button is clicked. To do so, we will call **setTab()** when that happens.

```jsx
<button className={styles.button} onClick={() => setTab("about")}>About</button>
<button className={styles.button} onClick={() => setTab("skills")}>Skills</button>
<button className={styles.button} onClick={() => setTab("projects")}>Projects</button>
```

We can now write the **if-else** statements. Separately, wrap your about, skills, and projects with

```jsx
{tab === "tabname" && ()}
```

such that **tabname** is the intended value of the tab (i.e. about/skills/projects) and the **p** tag containing your about, skills, or projects is located between the parentheses.

Now, when you click the About button, your about will appear; when you click the Skills button, your skills will appear; and when you click the Projects button, your projects will appear.

Congratulations! You have completed the project!
