# Setup

Make sure that you have installed [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your machine before getting started with the project. Also, check that you have a code editor/IDE installed; if you don't have one, I recommend installing [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

Once you have installed both Python and Visual Studio Code (or any code editor/IDE of your choice), create a Python file (a.k.a. **.py** file) and write

```py
print("Hello, World!")
```

Now, run your code!

<Quiz
    question="What do you see in the console?"
    choices={[`print("Hello, World!")`, `Hello, World!`]}
    correctAnsIndex={1}
    correctMessage="Nice! You're on the right track!"
    wrongMessage="Oops! Try again!"
/>

Alright! Let's get started!

# About the Project

Free Scrabble is a one-try, one-player game such that the player's objective is to form the highest scoring word possible (according to Scrabble letter values) in one try. The game will give the player 7 random, not necessarily distinct, uppercase letters to form the word with (the blank tile in Scrabble is excluded to make the game more challenging). The player then forms a valid Scrabble word using those letters and is finally given a score computed based on Scrabble letter values!

Now that we understand what we're going to do, let's begin coding!

# The Constants

In a game of Scrabble, we need all letters from A to Z. It'll be good if we could store them in a list, so let's do that!

```py
letters = [chr(i) for i in range(65, 91)]  # list of uppercase letters (A-Z)
```

The code above is a list comprehension converting ASCII codes into characters (strings).

Now, we need to link these letters to their values. Let's create another list called **points** and create a dictionary mapping each letter to its corresponding value.

```py
points = [1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 8, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 8, 4, 10]  # list of Scrabble letter values
letters_points = {letters: points for letters, points in zip(letters, points)} # dictionary of letters and points
```

We'll also need a list of valid Scrabble words to check our answer against. For that, I have included a text file filled with words [here](https://github.com/xyntechx/NexLiber-Projects/blob/main/Free%20Scrabble/words.txt). Let's read this file and transfer its contents to a list.

```py
words = []

with open("words.txt") as file: # open words.txt
    for word in file:
        words.append(word.strip().upper()) # append all words to an array
```

# Random Letters

Since we need 7 random letters, we need Python's built-in **random** module. We don't need to install anything, but we do need to import the module, specifically its **randint()** method. This is because we'll be using the random integer generated to index **letters**.

```py
from random import randint

inventory = []

for i in range(7): # pick 7 letters
    letter = letters[randint(0, len(letters) - 1)] # pick a random letter from letters
    inventory.append(letter) # add letter to inventory
```

# Gameplay

To start the game off, we will inform the player of the 7 letters they can use, and ask them to input a word.

```py
print("Possible letters to use:", inventory)
word = input("Enter word: ").strip().upper()
```

<Quiz
    question={`What is the purpose of "Enter word: " in input()`}
    choices={[
        `It is a prompt to alert the player on what to do`,
        `It is the value that will be passed into the variable word`,
        `It is for the coder to know what the use of input() in this case is`,
    ]}
    correctAnsIndex={0}
    correctMessage="Correct! The argument inside input() is a prompt and will not be passed into the variable word."
    wrongMessage="That's not quite right. Try again!"
/>

Let's also define a variable called **score** which holds an integer that is the player's score.

```py
score = 0
```

Now, we check whether the word is a valid Scrabble word by determining whether the word is in the **words** list. If it is, we loop over every character of the inputted word and see whether the character is in **inventory**. If it is, we remove the character from **inventory** and add the character's value to **score**.

If all goes well, we print out the player's score.

```py
if word in words:  # if the user creates a valid word
    for char in word:
        if char not in inventory:  # if the user enters an invalid letter
            print("Please only use the letters in your inventory")
            break
        else:
            inventory.remove(char)  # ensure the user only uses each occurrence of a letter once
            score += letters_points[char]
    else:  # if all letters are valid
        print("Good game! Your score is", score, ":D")
else:
    print("Remember to make a valid word!")
```

And that's it! Good work!
