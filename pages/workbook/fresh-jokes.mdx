# Setup

Follow the Get Started section of the [Fresh documentation](https://fresh.deno.dev/#getting-started). Enter **y** for the prompt **Do you want to use 'twind' (https://twind.dev/) for styling?** and, if you use VSCode, **Do you use VS Code?**.

Now, open your browser and visit **localhost:8000**.

<Quiz
    question="What image do you see?"
    choices={[`Nothing...`, `An blackberry`, `An apple`, `A lemon`]}
    correctAnsIndex={3}
    correctMessage="Awesome! Let's get started then!"
    wrongMessage="Are you sure you selected the right fruit?"

Open your project in your favourite text editor/IDE and let the development start!

# About the Project

This project is a website built using a new web framework (at the time of writing this workbook) called Fresh (version 1.0.0). The website will generate random jokes from a predetermined array of jokes as well as enable the user to input a joke and display it on the website.

Visiting Fresh Jokes, you will see the following page:

    alt="Initial state of the website"
    width={400}
    height={260}
/>

When you press the **Make My Own!** button, a simple form appears.

/>

# Project Structure

Make sure that your project has the structure as seen in the image below. Empty all the files as well!

# Homepage

The file **routes/index.tsx** specifies the content of the **/** route of the website. The code will be written in Typescript using JSX syntax, which is used to describe how a user interface (UI) should look like.

For Fresh to work, we will need to import **Preact**. **Twind** should also be imported into the project for styling.

```tsx
/** @jsx h */
import { h } from "preact";
import { tw } from "@twind";
```

The homepage includes a title to introduce what the website is about. Below the title, you will be displaying a random joke from an array of jokes in **utils/jokes.ts** , followed by buttons to display another joke and to fire up the form to create your own joke. Since these components below the title require client side interactivity, they are called islands, isolated client-rendered Preact components, to be included in the **islands** directory.

The islands for displaying the random joke and to create your own joke will be called **Joke** and **Create** respectively. According to Fresh guidelines, the TSX files describing each island's logic and UI must be named the name of the island in PascalCase.

In **routes/index.tsx**, add the following code.

```tsx
import Joke from "../islands/Joke.tsx";
import Create from "../islands/Create.tsx";

export default function Home() {
    return (
        <main class={tw`p-0 m-0 h-screen w-screen flex flex-col items-center justify-center`}>
            <h1 class={tw`p-0 m-2 text-2xl font-bold text-center`}>
                Your daily dose of `fresh` jokes!
            </h1>
            <Joke index={0} />
            <Create />
        </main>
    );
}
```

**tw\`...\`** specifies the Tailwind classes to style the elements.

# Array of Jokes

Let's now write the array of jokes in **utils/jokes.ts**. The code below creates a constant which is an array of strings. Feel free to modify the array yourself!

```ts
const JOKES: string[] = [
    "Why do Java developers often wear glasses? They can't C#.",
    "A SQL query walks into a bar, goes up to two tables and says “can I join you?”",
    "Wasn't hard to crack Forrest Gump's password. 1forrest1.",
    "I love pressing the F5 key. It's refreshing.",
    "Called IT support and a chap from Australia came to fix my network connection.  I asked “Do you come from a LAN down under?”",
    "There are 10 types of people in the world. Those who understand binary and those who don't.",
    "Why are assembly programmers often wet? They work below C level.",
    "My favourite computer based band is the Black IPs.",
    "What programme do you use to predict the music tastes of former US presidential candidates? An Al Gore Rhythm.",
    "An SEO expert walked into a bar, pub, inn, tavern, hostelry, public house.",
];

export default JOKES;
```

# Islands: Joke

This island will display a random joke and generate a new one from the array of jokes once the **Another One!** button is pressed.

To make this island work, you will need to import the **useState** hook to access and set the index of the joke to be displayed as well as the **JOKES** array from **utils/jokes.ts** for the random jokes.

```tsx
/** @jsx h */
import { h } from "preact";
import { useState } from "preact/hooks";
import { IS_BROWSER } from "$fresh/runtime.ts";
import { tw } from "@twind";
import JOKES from "../utils/jokes.ts";
```

For consistency, the first joke in the array will be displayed when the website is first visited. To achieve this, this island should have a parameter with type number to represent the index of the joke. You will then initialise the **index** state with the argument passed into the island, which in our case is 0.

Of course, you will need to display the random joke itself, which is done by indexing the **JOKES** array. The **Another One!** button will generate a random integer from 0 to the length of the array, set the integer as **index**, and finally change the displayed joke.

```tsx
interface Props {
    index: number;
}

export default function Joke(props: Props) {
    const [index, setIndex] = useState(props.index);
    const btn = tw`px-2 py-1 border(gray-100 1) hover:bg-yellow-100 w-max focus:outline-none mt-4`;
    const text = tw`p-0 m-2 text-xl`;

    return (
        <div class={tw`flex flex-col items-center justify-center`}>
            <p class={text}>{JOKES[index]}</p>
            <button
                class={btn}
                onClick={() => setIndex(Math.floor(Math.random() * JOKES.length))}
                disabled={!IS_BROWSER}
            >
                Another One!
            </button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

# Islands: Create

Similar to the previous island, this island requires the **useState** hook.

```tsx
/** @jsx h */
import { h } from "preact";
import { useState } from "preact/hooks";
import { tw } from "@twind";
```

This is because we would need to check whether the user is currently creating a joke, and check whether the user has submitted the joke to display it, and store the new joke (as a string).

```tsx
export default function Create() {
    const [isCreating, setIsCreating] = useState(false);
    const [show, setShow] = useState(false);
    const [joke, setJoke] = useState("");

    return()
}
```

When the user is not creating, the default **Make My Own!** button should be shown. Otherwise, the simple form to submit the joke must appear. The text input of the form should update the value of the **joke** state every time the user changes the value of the text input by typing. Once the submit button is pressed, the joke will be displayed.

In the **return** statement, write...

```tsx
<div class={tw`flex flex-col items-center justify-center`}>
    {isCreating ? (
        <div class={tw`flex flex-col items-center justify-center mt-10`}>
            <input
                class={tw`border(gray-100 1) rounded-md w-full text-lg py-1 px-2 focus:bg-yellow-100 focus:outline-none`}
                type="text"
                placeholder="Enter joke"
                onChange={(e) => setJoke(e.target.value)}
            />
            <button
                class={tw`px-2 py-1 mt-2 border(gray-100 1) hover:bg-yellow-100 focus:outline-none`}
                onClick={() => {
                    setShow(true);
                    setIsCreating(false);
                }}
            >
                Submit
            </button>
        </div>
    ) : (
        <button
            class={tw`px-2 py-1 mt-2 border(gray-100 1) hover:bg-yellow-100 focus:outline-none`}
            disabled={isCreating}
            onClick={() => {
                setIsCreating(true);
                setJoke("");
            }}
        >
            Make My Own!
        </button>
    )}
    {show && (
        <p class={tw`p-0 text-xl mt-10 w-screen bg-yellow-100 text-center`}>
            {joke}
        </p>
    )}
</div>
```
