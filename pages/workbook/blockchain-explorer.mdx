# Setup

This project assumes basic understanding of asynchronous JavaScript, and I'd recommend you to check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn3tm0quoqE) course to learn it quickly.

Make sure to install [Node (version 16.17.0)](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine, and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), should you need a code editor / IDE.

Once that's done, hop into a new folder, create an **index.js** file (in VSCode) and write:

```js
console.log("1 + 1");
```

Then, open your command prompt, and run the server with **node index.js**

<Quiz
  question="What do you see in the terminal?"
  choices={[`1`, `11`, `10`, `1 + 1`]}

Alright, let's install one more dependency in the command prompt:

```bash
npm install --save ethers
```

…and let's get started!

# About the Project

This Workbook will guide you through the process of interacting with the blockchain, while introducing you to some of more important technicalities. At the end, you will have a command line interface to query balances, use smart contracts and interact with ERC-20 tokens.

# Blockchain: in brief

In grossly simplified terms, the Ethereum blockchain, like many others, is simply a centralised ledger (basically a big dictionary of addresses and balances), which is mutated through transactions, and controlled through the consensus mechanism. Consider reading [this](https://www.preethikasireddy.com/post/how-does-ethereum-work-anyway) comprehensive introduction to understand blockchain better.

# Querying Balances

Every blockchain has a native token, which can be used to pay transaction fees (gas), run smart contracts, or purchase real-world goods. <br />⇒ for example, ether on Ethereum, Sol on Solana, etc.

To interact with this native token on the Ethereum blockchain, let's first clear our **index.js**, and import the ethers library.

```js
const { ethers } = require("ethers");
```

To connect with the blockchain, a **Provider** must first be instantiated.

```js
const provider = ethers.getDefaultProvider();
```

With this, we now gain access to a range of asynchronous utility functions. To provide a testbed for testing, let's create a quick async/await function:

```js
...
async function getBalance() {
// most ethers code goes here

}

getBalance();
```

Let's first query the balance of a random wallet, and put this following code <u>inside the function</u> you just created:

```js
const address = "0x5555763613a12D8F3e73be831DFf8598089d3dCa";
const balance = await provider.getBalance(address);
console.log(balance);
```

… and run the server again with **node ./index.js**

# Formatting Balances

If you've gotten a response from the last step, you might notice the weird **BigNumber** data type. This data type contains a hexstring (under **\_hex**), which must be parsed to obtain a floating point value.

To do this, let's first import **formatEther** from the **ethers/utils** library first.

```js
const { formatEther } = require("@ethersproject/units");
```

and refactor the code from earlier into this:

```js
// most ethers code goes here
const address = "0x5555763613a12D8F3e73be831DFf8598089d3dCa";
const balance = await provider.getBalance(address);
const parsedBalance = formatEther(balance);

console.log(parsedBalance);
```

Now let's just change the final logging statement slightly:

```js
console.log(
  `The address ${requestedAddress} has a balance of ${parsedBalance} ether.`
);
```

…and then run the server with the **node ./index.js** command from earlier.

<AsyncQuiz
  question="How much ether does the address 0x5555763613a12D8F3e73be831DFf8598089d3dCa have?"
  balanceIndex={0}
  weights={[0.97, 0.93, 1, 1.01]}
  correctAnsIndex={2}
  correctMessage="Good job! You're on the right track!"
  wrongMessage="Oops! Try again!"
/>

# Adding Interactivity

Alright, final step: let's get users to key in addresses they want to query, instead of hardcoding it in. First, instantiate a variable to hold this address, adding **let requestedAddress;** below the provider.

Let's then create a quick loop to:

1. Prompt users to key an address.
2. Use the **isAddress** utility to check the validity of the address, and loop back to the prompt if it's invalid.

First off, let's install **prompt-sync** through the terminal:

```bash
npm install prompt-sync
```

Then, import **isAddress** and this new library:

```js
  …
  const { isAddress } = require("@ethersproject/address");
  const prompt = require("prompt-sync")({ sigint: true });
```

and then replace the **const address = …** statement with

```js
while (true) {
  requestedAddress = prompt(
    "Which address' balance would you like to query?: "
  );

  if (isAddress(requestedAddress)) {
    console.log("retrieving balance...");
    break;
  } else {
    console.log(
      "Invalid address! Make sure to include the '0x' at the start..."
    );
  }
}
```

and finally, change the **address** in **getBalance()** to **requestedAddress**.

<AsyncQuiz
  question="How much ether does address 0x07EA23D8efb70Db2A7AEd8E77a93dD83cd12Fa53 have?"
  balanceIndex={1}
  weights={[1.07, 0.95, 0.98, 1]}
  correctAnsIndex={3}
  correctMessage="Good job! Let's move on to the next section."
  wrongMessage="Oops! Try again!"
/>

# Interacting with ERC-20 Tokens:

Now besides the native currency, some blockchains have smart contracts, which can be used to create a separate token on the same blockchain. In this Workbook, we will interact with Dai, a ERC-20 (i.e. non-native) token. Let's first create a new asynchronous function:

```js
…
getBalance()

async function getTokenBalance() {
  // most ethers code goes here
}
getTokenBalance()
```

In the function, we first create an abstraction of the smart contract:

```js
const daiAddress = "0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F";
const daiAbi = ["function balanceOf(address) view returns (uint256)"];
const daiContract = new ethers.Contract(daiAddress, daiAbi, provider);
```

For your information, the **daiAbi** is needed to specify which functions from the contract will be retrieved, and defined locally.

We then get an address with the prompt we wrote earlier:

```js
while (true) {
  requestedAddress = prompt(
    "What address' balance would you like to retrieve?: "
  );

  if (isAddress(requestedAddress)) {
    console.log("retrieving balance...");
    break;
  } else {
    console.log(
      "Invalid address! Make sure to include the '0x' at the start..."
    );
  }
}
```

and grab its balance of Dai with the following code:

```js
const balance = await daiContract.balanceOf(requestedAddress);
```

To parse the balance, we must now use this code:

```js
const parsedBalance = parseInt(balance._hex, 16) / 10 ** 18;
```

Again, it is worth noting that values are stored as integers on the blockchain (and in balance.\_hex). This balance is actually raised to 10<sup>18</sup> of the true value (for dai and ether), providing 18 artificial decimal places.

Now, we log out the balance:

```js
console.log(
  `The address ${requestedAddress} has a balance of ${parsedBalance} DAI.`
);
```

…and then re-run the server with **node ./index.js**

<AsyncQuiz
  question="How much Dai does address 0xfeb0387ed65409a1aa7b0689dc9328a12d64001c have?"
  balanceIndex={2}
  weights={[1.05, 1, 0.96, 1.09]}
  correctAnsIndex={1}
  correctMessage="Good job! Congrats on finishing the project!"
  wrongMessage="Oops! Try again!"
/>

Congratulations! You have completed the project! Feel free to find and play around with some addresses from [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) or the [Dai contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f), and consider checking out [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62f757RVEvU&ab_channel=EatTheBlocks) to start writing your own smart contracts!
