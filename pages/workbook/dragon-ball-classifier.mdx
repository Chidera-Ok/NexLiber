# Setup

This project will be done on Google Colaboratory (Colab), so no installations on your local machine is necessary. However, you do need to sign into your Google Account in order to use Colab. Once you have done so, visit [Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/) and create a new **.ipynb** file by clicking **New Notebook**. You will see a new empty notebook with a single empty code cell.

# About the Project

You will be building an image classifier using [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). The machine learning model will be classifying [Dragon Ball](https://en.dragon-ball-official.com/) characters, specifically Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, and Trunks. If you want to know why Dragon Ball, it's because I'm a fan ;).

# Preparing the Dataset

Our image classifier needs data, specifically images of the aforementioned Dragon Ball characters, to be trained on. I have prepared **.csv** files containing the URLs of various images of each of the 4 Dragon Ball characters [here](https://github.com/xyntechx/Dragon-Ball-Classifier/tree/main/dragonball). Download the files to your local machine, then upload them onto Colab's Files side panel in a folder named **dragonball**.

# Installations and Imports

In the empty code cell in your notebook, you may write commands to install fastai and PyTorch. To fix compatibility issues unique for Colab, you will also need to uninstall several preinstalled packages on Colab.

```py
!pip uninstall "torchtext" "torchaudio"
!pip install "torch==1.4.0" "torchvision==0.5.0"
from fastai.vision import *
import os
```

The **!** signals Colab that the line is a command normally run directly in the terminal, not code in the traditional sense.

# Building the Dataset

Currently, we only have the URLs of the images to train our model on, not the images themselves. We will be downloading the images of each character to Colab into separate subfolders of **/dragonball**. First things first, let's create the subfolders.

```py
for character in characters:
    path = Path("dragonball")
    dest = path/character
    dest.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
```

Wait! We haven't assigned a value to the list named **characters**! Given that it needs to contain the names of the characters we want to classify, what should be the value of **characters**?

<Quiz
    question="characters = "
    choices={[
        `["goku", "gohan", "trunks"]`,
        `["vegeta", "piccolo", "gohan", "trunks"]`,
        `["vegeta", "goku", "gohan", "trunks"]`,
    ]}
    correctAnsIndex={2}
    correctMessage="That's right! We will be training the model to identify Vegeta, Goku, Gohan, and Trunks."
    wrongMessage="Are you sure?"
/>

Now, we have to download the images using the URLs in the **.csv** files.

```py
for character in characters:
    path = Path("dragonball")
    csv_file = Path("dragonball/" + character + ".csv")
    dest = path/character
    download_images(csv_file, dest, max_pics=100)
```

We also have to remove any images which can't be opened so that our model can be trained smoothly.

```py
for character in characters:
    path = Path("dragonball")
    verify_images(path/character, delete=True, max_size=500)
```

# Training the Model

Now that we have our dataset, we can train the image classification model.

```py
data = ImageDataBunch.from_folder(path, train=".", valid_pct=0.2, ds_tfms=get_transforms(), size=224, num_workers=4).normalize(imagenet_stats)
learner = cnn_learner(data, models.resnet101, metrics=accuracy)
learner.fit_one_cycle(20)
```

The first line grabs all the valid images from **/dragonball** and labels each of them with the names of their corresponding characters. The second line creates the model with ResNet101, a convolutional neural network with 101 layers, as its backbone. Can you guess what the third line does?

<Quiz
    question="The third line..."
    choices={[
        `trains the model in 20 epochs or "rounds"`,
        `creates 20 models and chooses the best one`,
        `repeatedly trains the model in 20 minutes`,
    ]}
    correctAnsIndex={0}
    correctMessage="Correct!"
    wrongMessage="Try Again!"
/>

# Interpreting the Results

Good job! Your model can now identify four Dragon Ball characters! To get a visualisation of how accurate it is, run the following code.

```py
interp = ClassificationInterpretation.from_learner(learner)
interp.plot_confusion_matrix()
```

# Testing the Model

Now, I'm sure that you'd want to see your model in action on random images of the four characters not found in the dataset you've created. I have prepared exactly that [here](https://github.com/xyntechx/Dragon-Ball-Classifier/tree/main/test). Download the 4 images and upload them onto Colab's Files side panel in a folder named **test**. Images 1, 2, 3, and 4 are images of Vegeta, Goku, Gohan, and Trunks respectively.

```py
model = load_learner(path)

for i in range(4):
    img_path = "test/" + str(i+1) + ".png"
    img = open_image(img_path)
    pred_class, pred_idx, outputs = model.predict(img)

    print(pred_class)
    print(data.classes)
    print(outputs)
```

The code above loads the model and uses it to predict the character in each of the 4 test images. It then prints out the results of the prediction. If your model is not as accurate as you hope it to be, don't hesitate to tweak some training parameters after learning about them in the [fastai documentation](https://docs.fast.ai/).

That's all for the project! Feel free to include more Dragon Ball characters, or even build more models for different shows, movies, etc.
