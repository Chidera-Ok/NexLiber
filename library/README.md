# Guide for Creators
Thank you for your interest in becoming a Creator! Follow the steps below to start your journey with NexLiber!

## Fork This repository
Since you do not have write access to `xyntechx/NexLiber`, you have to fork this repository before creating a pull request with the project you have in mind. Follow GitHub's official guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) to learn how you can fork a repository.

## Add Your Project
Here are the step-by-step instructions you should follow:
- Put all the files and folders of your complete working project into one main overarching folder
- Add a `README.md` file to the root directory of the main folder - follow the format of this [template](https://github.com/xyntechx/NexLiber/blob/main/library/TEMPLATE.md)
- Name the main folder your **Project Title** (e.g. Free Scrabble)
- Place the main folder into the `/library` directory of your fork
- Commit your changes with the message "New Project: **Project Title**"
- Push your changes to your fork's remote repository (the fork on your GitHub account)

## Create a Pull Request
Now, create a Pull Request (PR) to the original `xyntechx/NexLiber` repository by following GitHub's official guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

Things to note:
- Title your PR "New Project: **Project Title**"
- Enter the **project description**, **field**, and **difficulty** in the comment field
- Additionally, enter your **name**, **GitHub username**, and **Discord username** in the comment field too

Your project will undergo some checks to ensure that it is fully functional. Once the checks are complete, your project must be reviewed and approved by an admin before it is merged into the main branch.

## Next Steps
Upon merging, you will be assigned an Editor to monitor your progress in drafting the Workbook of your project. Once you have completed your Workbook, it will be put up on NexLiber, and you will be a published NexLiber Creator!
